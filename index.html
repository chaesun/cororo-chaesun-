            <h1>the wisdom of fixing a barn after losing a cow</h1>
            The new year of 2009 has dawned. The situation at home and abroad has been bleak over the past year, and there is no particular sign of improvement just because the year has changed. But we hope by changing the calendar. There is also an inverse conjunction of 'Nevertheless'. Isn't the world a little brighter because there are people who have dreams even in a bloody reality? The reason for reading classics may be to find and cultivate these hopes. 
            <br>At the end of the year, four character idioms that summarize the year are on the media. The idiom of 2008 selected by the "Professor's Newspaper" is said to be "Hojilgiui". This word is based on the following article in "Tongseo" by Zhu Donyi of the Song Dynasty of China. 
            <br>Jungyu loved to hear his faults, so his beautiful name was handed down forever. However, people today don't like to be pointed out by others even if they have faults. It's like hiding a disease and being reluctant to find a doctor, so he doesn't realize it even if he ruins his body. 
            <br>It's a harsh word for me, who tries to put up with it rather than going to the hospital. This is because they make an excuse to develop resistance on their own, but in fact, they cannot deny their desire to avoid the pain of treatment. Even if the disease recurs, it's tomorrow. 
            <br>I have an experience that comes to mind when I feel ashamed of my dullness, which only thinks of immediate problems and is not afraid of the future. It is a surprise that I felt when I learned the original meaning of Mangyangboreung while reading "The Book of War." 
            <br>At the end of the Warring States Period, Zhang Xin of the Chao Dynasty criticized the actual situation of King Yang and went to the Zhao Dynasty. Later, King Yang, who realized that the point was correct, called in a tall man to ask for countermeasures, and his answer begins like this. 
            <br>I hear people around the world say, "It's not too late to find a rabbit and look around a hound, and it's not too late to lose a sheep and fix a barn." 亡羊而補牢, 未爲遲也.”) 
            <br>I was embarrassed for a moment in front of this phrase, thinking foolishly of "losing a sheep and fixing a barn." When I looked up the Korean jade pieces that were widely used at the time, I found that the meaning of "Mangyangboro" was the same as "fixing the barn after losing the cow," and the explanation of the Korean dictionary, which is said to be the largest in Korea, was the same. Isn't this a completely reverse reading of the meaning of this word, which originated from the "National Book"? 
            <br>On reflection, the barn must be repaired even after losing the sheep. This is the wisdom not to repeat past mistakes. In fact, all of the previous examples of 'Mangyang Boryo' were used in this positive sense. When I deliberately used this word while talking to a Chinese friend, he clearly praised the scheme of "losing sheep and fixing the barn." The wisdom of the people of the Warring States Period has now been extended to the Chinese. Despite the ups and downs of history, it seemed to know why China did not lose its identity. And I thought it would be good to call the "National Book," which conveys these words and wisdom that have been circulating in the world since ancient times, as a classic. Perhaps China's emerging power in the 21st century is due to its preparation for the future by reflecting on the lessons of history. 
            <br>But why have we laughed at the loss of cattle and fixing the barn as foolish? One can say that the proverb reveals the reality of China and other Korea. In fact, in Korea, sheep were rarely raised, and farmers usually only hit one cow. If we lose one of our sheep, we will have to fix it, but when the only cow runs away, it will be after we have already lost everything, so we don't have to. Therefore, some may argue that the process of "Mangyangboreung" turning into a proverb "fixing the barn after losing the cow" is the wisdom of seeking self-reliance. However, if you don't intend to raise cattle again, we can't help but work on it. Laughing at fixing the barn is nothing more than a short-sighted historical view that only knows the immediate utility. 
            <br>As is well known, "National Book" is a collection of dialects and conversations with kings of the Warring States Period. What we are seeing now is part of a book compiled by Liu Hyang in the previous words, and it is difficult to say that it is a reliable history book. However, the contents of the book are not groundless fabrications and reflect the reality of the Warring States Period. Excavated in 1973 from the tomb of Mawangtoe in Jangsa, "The Book of War" proves that articles such as "The Book of War" have already been widely read in one second. The new book written in the previous words also abbreviates the conversation between King Cho Yang and Jang Jang, and even if the expression has changed a little, the wisdom of Mangyangboreung is still preserved. 
            <br>The Warring States Period was an unprecedented period of confusion and upheaval in Chinese history. The existing order and principles became meaningless, and in the midst of this, the argument of the law family, which emphasized that the world had changed, prevailed. The logic of Hanbi, who used the precedent story in the past as a sarcastic point of "Suju Daeto," helped create a new state system for Qin Shi Huang. However, even during this period, there were many people in the world with the wisdom of "Mangyang Boreung," who reflected on the past's mistakes through long breathing. This word continued to be reflected in the establishment of a royal occupation that would last hundreds of years by adjusting the achievements and mistakes of the Qin Dynasty. Perhaps this practice of "Mangyangbo-ryo" not only kept the Han Dynasty alive, but also made a long history of China. 
            <br>The so-called "modern" has greatly changed the world, and today we tend to ignore memories and experiences from earlier times. Those who think that humans have always lived only as "selfish beings" are good examples. It is easy to make this mistake even if you shout that you have now faced a 'transition period of literary nouns'. The current system is the only civilization for them, and they only predict the future and have no time to look back on the past. If you lose a cow, you don't care about fixing the barn soon. But isn't there any past facts to ponder in order to properly cope with the uncertain future? Even if a new world approaches, there are people who have lived at the center for a long time. Even if you don't go looking for a cow like the main character in Simwoodo Island, it is necessary to fix the barn first. If cattle are important...…. 
            <br>It was a very frustrating and sad year. Someone made a mistake or a mistake, and somewhere there was a mistake and a mistake. I want to forget all this, but I can't as long as we breathe in here. This is why I recall unpleasant memories from the beginning of the new year. We've lost our cows, but we've got to work on them nonetheless. The world has kept this wisdom, and we have lived by reading the classics that convey it. Through this, history continues, and at the center of it were people with dreams and hopes. And they will never laugh at fixing the barn after losing the cow as stupid. 
            <br>(Chugi) The Han-Han Dae Dictionary of Oriental Studies at Dankook University, which was published last year, properly explained the meaning of Mangyangboreung. Here we confirm our hopes.
